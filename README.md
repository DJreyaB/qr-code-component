## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
<!-- - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles -->

### What I learned
Instantiating variables in css for ease of usage with the :root and var()

```css
:root{
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    --dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to develop more advanced techniques in pure css and then transition to using more add-ons like bootstrap, to improve the website flow and aesthetic. I'd also like to incoporate mor javascript to add in more movement to the website builds.
